Nuxt is a free and [open-source framework](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt) with an intuitive and extendable way to create type-safe, performant and production-grade full-stack web applications and websites with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org).

We made everything so you can start writing `.vue` files from the beginning while enjoying hot module replacement in development and a performant application in production with server-side rendering by default.

Nuxt has no vendor lock-in, allowing you to deploy your application [**everywhere, even on the edge**](/blog/nuxt-on-the-edge).

## Automation and Conventions

Nuxt uses conventions and an opinionated directory structure to automate repetitive tasks and allow developers to focus on pushing features. The configuration file can still customize and override its default behaviors.
